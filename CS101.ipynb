    "## [Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure)\n",
    "In computer science, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an array of 10 32-bit integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ... 2036, so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + 4 × i.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cool part here is that knowing the memory address of the starting element, it is possible to immediately calculate the address of the desired $i^{th}$ element.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given example the array can contain 10 elements of any value available to the int type. In C, the array element indices are 0-9 inclusive in this case. For example, the expressions anArrayName[0] and anArrayName[9] are the first and last elements respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a vector with linear addressing, the element with index i is located at the address B + c × i, where B is a fixed base address and c a fixed constant, sometimes called the **address increment or stride**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant B is simply the address of the first element of the array. For this reason, the C programming language specifies that array indices always begin at 0; and many programmers will call that element \"zeroth\" rather than \"first\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For a multidimensional array, the element with indices i,j would have address B + c · i + d · j, where the coefficients c and d are the row and column address increments, respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**  \n",
    "Retrieval of the ith element requires only an elementary mathematical calculation, hence it is very efficient  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**  \n",
    "If an element takes less than the stride to be stored, this will not reflect in the memory allocation for the array: the array size is specified upfront, and the memory allocated needs to be contingent"

    "\n",
    "In computing, a hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause hash collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. Such collisions must be accommodated in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a well-dimensioned hash table, the average cost (number of instructions) for each lookup is independent of the number of elements stored in the table. Many hash table designs also allow arbitrary insertions and deletions of key-value pairs, at (amortized) constant average cost per operation.\n",
